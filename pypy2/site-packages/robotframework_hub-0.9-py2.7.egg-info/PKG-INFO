Description: # Welcome to Robot Framework Hub
        
        This is a very early version of a server for the robot framework
        testing framework. The hub uses flask to provide both a RESTful
        interface and a browser-based UI for accessing test assets. 
        
        It's crazy easy to get started. To install and run from a PyPi
        package, do the following:
        
        ```
            $ pip install robotframework-hub
            $ python -m rfhub
        ```
        
        To run from source it's the same, except intead of installing,
        you cd to the folder that has this file. 
        
        That's it! You can now browse documentation by visiting the url
        http://localhost:7070/doc/
        
        Want to browse your local robotframework assets? Just include
        the path to your test suites or resource files on the command
        line:
        
        ```
            $ python -m rfhub /path/to/test/suite
        ```
